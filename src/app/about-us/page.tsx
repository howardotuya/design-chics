            <p>
              In the early stages of Dinma Anuigbo&apos;s career, she often
              found herself as the only woman on her design teams. This
              isolation fueled her desire for connection, support, and
              inspiration from other female designers. She realized that many
              women faced similar challenges and needed a strong community for
              career growth.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Driven by this vision, She shared her ideas with Oyindamola
              Ajiboye (Dammy) to create a community for female designers across
              Africa.
